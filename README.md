This is my first introduction to:
-Flask framework
-SCSS (Sassy CSS) or SASS (Syntectically Awesome Cadcading Style Sheet)
-HTML and 
-SQL Alchemy
This project is built for task management. It enables the user to add,create, remove and edit tasks.
The user interface is styled in SCSS which compiles automatically to CSS.
The app consists of a database (SQLAlchemy)
For dependencies refer to the requirements.txt
